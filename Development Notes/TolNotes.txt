TOL Notes

1)
The reason the character set flickers between definition and blank is because
of the way we have coded the character sets.
if >95 the character is always redefined using the second set irrespective
of what it contains.

The reason for >95 characters is for "same character, different colour"
scenarios.

We don't want this, because redefining the character is both wasteful of
memory (duplicate data) and of time (greatly reduces game speed).
However, we need to choose a method that is both fast and efficient.

we could use an additional 64 byte table to determine which characters
posess a second definition and which do not.

2)
Code landmarks...

2.1) Creature Foe
2.2) Fight code
2.3) dropped item code
2.4) examine and use item code
2.5) sfx
2.6) Candle and life control
2.7) hero speed depending on health

Sub-Quests
Sub-Quests may assist you to gain more gold, Weapons or Artifacts such as...

Sub-Quest 1 - Fetching STONE KEY and Magical BOW AND ARROW
The Bow and Arrow reside within the Temple of Angor grounds which are not
accessable on foot since the Temple is completely surrounded by a castle
wall.
It is accessable through a Breech, a short underground tunnel that is only
accessable with the Stone Key.
The Stone key may be bought from Calibor.

Sub-Quest 2 - Fetching the MEAD CHIME and GOLD of TempleMead
TempleMead does not contain anything useful usually on-foot.
However, with the Mead Chime in posession and using it in the sacred place
will summon the gold to surface.
The Mead Chime may be bought from Bombadil in Sleepy River(Rumous).
The generation and position of Gold is random.

Sub-Quest 3 - Fetching the CLOAK of Disguise
The Cloak is found in Phnang Province which is only accessable with the Map
Book. The Cloak will only show itself if the hero has the "Tin Clasp" in
his/her posession
The Tin Clasp may be bought from Calibor

Sub-Quest 4 - Fetching the BOOTS
Rumours should reveal it can be bought from Barton in Treela

Sub-Quest 5 - Fetching the DAGGER
Located next to Woodmans Lodge

Sub-Quest 6 - Fetching the HOLY WATER (Dispells Skeletons)
The Holy Water may be bought in Rhyder off the Dark Prior

Sub-Quest 7 - Fetching the CROSS (Kills Ghosts)
The Cross is located on the inner isle north of the enchanted Forest.
However the inner isle is usually isolated, and never appears in the
Book.
The Hero must travel to Sleepy River and buy the Wand of Nesteroth.
When used on the River bank just north of Sleepy River, a Bridge will appear.
The Hero may then cross the bridge.
The Nesteroth isle creatures (like the black asps on Samson) are dark evil
creatures who cannot be killed.
At best they must be avoided, but once the Cross is picked up, they will
not disturb the hero.

Sub-Quest 8 - Fetching the AXE (Infinite axes)
The Axe is located on Samson, but their is no tunnel to it. The only way to
get to Samson is by using the Book. However the Book only
contains a list of known places, and Samson is unlikely to be known.
However, chitchat in Lankwell (Only) to the Wickerman (Only) will
reveal SAMSON.
In addition to this, the Wickerman resides at the WillowBranch in Lankwell
which may only be opened when in posession of the Twine.

The Isle is plagued with black Asps (Invincible) who also carry and throw
axes.
The Axe may be found north of the Pond

The Map Book is found in Underworld #2 (Agrechant)
The Twine may be bought from the head orc in the Dark Forest

Sub-Quest 9 - Ring
The Ring is found to the south of the Dessert.
Rumours will reveal this.

Problems With Underground Switches
When the hero walks over the switch, the switch does it's job but twice
because their is not enough time for the hero to move away.
The best way to fix this afaik is to delete the switch from the background
buffer when the hero uses it.
It will then dissapear and only reappear when the hero returns.
But how to know exactly where switch is in bg map?
