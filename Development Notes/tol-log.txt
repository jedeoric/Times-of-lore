They now fire when 'inline' with hero
050223.0019.1F) Character corruption on buildings after visiting Mountains
This was not due to some code problem but a problem with the data. Their are
two main character sets that must reside at page boundaries 600 and 800, but
because of 050219.1427.1F the address was 10 bytes out, causing corruption
when the second set was called upon and then when the first set was restored.
050225.2154.1F) X and Y test display coordinates would be cool (Dbug)
Press RETURN during gameplay to display the heroes current X/Y position.
This will prove invaluable when finding mistakes in the map.
050221.0032.1F) Plot and game-path not written or set

Time of day now implemented. A day lasts 8 minutes, and each time of day is
indicated by a change in the lighting (Colours change). A message also
displays the time of day.

Dot-Map updated (Map on screen). Rhyder, Lankwell, Eralan validated.
050220.0121.1F) Names of Villages, Towns and Cities not declared
Region names now displayed as hero traverses land
050220.1934.1F) Internal Code: collision detection duplicated in places
050220.2032.1F) Search square for creature-hero attack too high in sb-buffer
               This means when hero goes to attack creature(esp. facing north)
               the creature must be at least 4 characters away to be hit,
               any closer and hitting has no effect
This is because the offset was one character position out. Placing two
SEC in the is_collision seems to have sorted this out.
050221.0033.2F) Gate&Door locations need to be updated
Gate&Door locs updated
050225.1849.1F) Creatures keep being generated in bushes and 'walls'
Block code at fault, although still a little unreliable, alot better than
before.
050310.2156.1F) Projectiles should be relative to ground (Not hero)
The problem was that the projectiles are mapped on the screen so when
the hero moved, they kept at their position. 4 special routines added to force
projectiles relative to the ground.
050314.1128.1F) BG road corners not defined enough, causing mass confusion
Roads and paths redefined, adding penalty of extra memory needed, but
have common road/path styles making more distinct routes.
050318.1253.1F) Bottom two options corrupt candle sconce
Sconce colour was being set in bottom-right option box, so reset colour
to White seems to correct the problem
050312.1713.1F) BG Animations are corrupt and too short(6>>8)
Memory limits almost reached so number of frames not increased, however
animations now corrected and river, firepit and sea validated
050220.2026.1F) Creatures(Foe) don't attack Opposite creatures (Friends)
Foes now attack friends, Friends attack Foes, Foes attack Foes but Friends do
not attack friends.

Underworld Switch code now added
050403.2008.2F) Underworld Gates don't work
Underworld gates now coded! and work (Use floor switches to toggle)
050404.2045.1F) Running over floor switches toggles twice.
The floor switch is now deleted from the background buffer, so the hero just
has to move out of view of it to re-enter and see it again.
050404.2239.1F) Buying item does not delete item from Creatures posessions
The index for where to reset the posession from the creatures list was
actually taken from the option list. Had to add some code to locate the
correct offset.
050219.1419.1F) Wrong mask on particular hero frame
New plot routines have appeared to clear this one.
050219.1419.3F) Map Corruption (Bad river bank) and Castle Wall in Eralan
Castle Wall Removed but still corruption on Sand(Dessert)/Grass
The problem is with Tiles in TSMAP not matching tiles in CBMTEXT TOL05.CBT
Latest maps seem to have sorted this issue
050221.0033.1F) Special dropped items not plotted

050219.1456.1F) 'drop item' and 'next page' keys redundant
               Should be changed to Use Scroll, Use Potion
No, changed to last/next object. This has also over-ridden the test key RET
But as consequence has freed up some memory!
050402.2043.1F) Enemies appear too often
Creature generation code was being run every 16th game cycle. Reduced to
64th game cycle.
050224.2249.1F) Rogues and Skeletons don't Fire enough
Rogues and Skeletons do now.
050405.1835.2F) Vertical Firing enemies crash Candle
Enemies like Rogue and Skeleton fire, but less often, so candle not bombarded
with decrements. However Candle not quite right, so another issue raised.
050406.2332.1F) Disc Routines not coded
Disc routines coded, since waiting for jede is like waiting for God sometimes!
050408.2252.1F) Original Candle Stem offset by one pixel to updated stem

Doesn't seem to occur anymore
050405.1835.3F) Candle Corruption when life changes
Candle will remain at top, but sconce will move up to meet eol
050407.1920.1F) ChitChat questions like "any news around the kingdom?" should
               expect a response like "Barton in Treela.." but chitchat like
               "nice weather we've been having" should get a response like
               "Yes, has been quite nice".
To conserve memory, only one question is posed by hero, "Any rumouts?"
050407.1926.2F) Move Page 2 into top of memory to free space in lower
Page 2 now resides where it was, but space is filled with exclusion_table
050407.1926.3X) Sort Character defs for objects held better

               buying something else is causing a corruption in his
               introduction text
Replaced keyword with letters, because it is envisaged that
chitchat_interaction can only take place once the hero meets Calibor.
050407.1933.1F) Fill Top of Memory spare slots with lower memory tables to
                free space
With only a couple of places now, i have managed to draw 1K from main mem.
050412.1933.1F) Flushing keys for next page causes annoying delay
This was a previous fix, I have removed the fix now
050414.2303.1F) Corruption of B26E - (Approx)B507 when hero jumps to Angor
The fault is still unknown but has been fixed. Temp_04 appears to be dodgy as
in that it is modified by something unknown during the background_refresh.
So i have used a txa/pha instead and this corrects the problem.
050415.1929.1F) Rumours are getting corrupted. "We don't hear from      P     "
When a keyword is known, a space was inserted instead of a colour, however
this made the actual keyword become 32!
050422.1145.1F) Corruption of creature names
It took a weekend and two days to figure out that a branch went to the
wrong place!

Now 4 Magic weapons are available

To restore friendship, hero must become in posession and use the Medallion
050413.2006.1F) Sort Silderons in tol_text, counted 3 so far but only 1
               should be present. The chosen 1 should be in location_list too.

to a creature). The particular response may be dependant on the creature being
asked, so a creature field is provided and duplicate keywords are permitted
050413.2026.1F) Ganestor is not covered in any of the quests!
Hard cheddar!, It is covered when discovering whereabouts of Agrechant
050417.1156.1F) Jumping does not update Map pixel location
It does update map display, but the problem is that the pixel map is in places
limited by inverse bytes, and where this occurs (such as Angor) the map pixel
will not change until map pixel CAN be relocated!
If another method can be suggested, then please put them forward.
Note: Map pixel should dissapear when in Phnang or on islands!
050427.0002.1F) Sun/moon and Lighting control are not synchronised
tod_quarter code removed from irq handler and now lighting is completely
handled by sunNmoon code.
050429.0001.1F) 8th Spare key should be USE shortcut

note: 7th is E(Replenish Energy)
050429.0002.1F) Special effects for Magical weapons are acting on screenbuffer
               but should be acting on actual screen.
Now act correctly, however have avoided plotting creatures after.
050224.2244.1F) Dropped objects sometimes appear from nowhere or at different
               loc to where creature died
When a hero is plotted, the current screen x/y are stored to tables so that
the drop items routine instantly knows where the hero died on screen.
However, if the hero dies offscreen and was never seen onscreen, the last
creatures screen x/y was being used.
050225.1936.1X) Shooting a dying animation is blocking the animation (Dbug)
               Preventing the hero to turn an kill in other direction
I am going to keep this as is. The gameplay has vastly improved anyway since.
050227.0201.1X) Foe doesn't seek way around bg obstacle
Again, i am going to leave this as is. Foe does is some situations and doesn't
in others.
050310.2004.1X) Menu options should have key options (Idea only) (Dbug)
Menu items don't have key options, however, to ease gameplay the two spare
keys have now been assigned to replenish Life-Force (If a green vial is -
posessed) and Use something.
050318.1340.1X) Creature Friends should be able to enter buildings (Any)
This is more difficult than it sounds, because i would then need to include
the creatures in the contents of an inn.
050427.2001.1X) Changing the map display has upset Templemead location.
Not a problem since not coded yet!!
050428.2200.1F) Hero should not posess keywords or posessions at start
               Hero should also start with 500 Gold coins and 2 rations
050310.2211.1X) Heroes hit foe contact is not relative to heroes direction
This will not be fixed because it assists in addressing 050225.1936.1X)
050429.2003.1F) Sunmoon starts at midnight, should start midday.
Though original screen shows moon, the counters start at midday.
050407.1926.1F) Move Page 0 into top of memory to free space in lower
Page 0 setup code (driver.s) now in AB40-AC3F
050430.1545.1F) Questions coming up blank
Code change
050430.2211.1F) I had 82 gold coins but lodgings(50) not enough
The values for rations and lodging are not taken from tol_text, and
where not put into the posession_price fields, so the lodging price
displayed was incorrect. Lodging is 200 whilst rations is 100.
050501.1406.1F) Need to review special dropped object code.
Seems to be ok now due to repositioning of note
050502.0028.1F) Toxic mist should turn everything to red col-mix for the period
